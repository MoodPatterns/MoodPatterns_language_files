            <h2>Benefits of mood tracking</h2>
            <p>Mood tracking can help healthy people stay emotionally healthy and assist people with
                mental diseases, such as bipolar disorder and depression, in their health
                management. It helps you to gather knowledge about your feelings, find
                associations between the tracked data and your health conditions, and proactively
                engage in healthcare management. Thereby mood tracking increases awareness and
                proactive self-regulation of emotional well-being.
            </p>
            <h2>Classic mood tracker apps</h2>
            <p>One of the most convenient ways to track your mood is to use a mood tracker app.
                Classic mood tracking apps usually work in one of two ways. Either they are (1)
                diaries and ask the user once a day how they have felt during the day, or they are
                (2) event trackers and users can input their mood whenever they feel like it.
                Unfortunately, both approaches have their shortcomings.
            </p>
            <h3>The problem with diaries</h3>
            <p>Diaries are usually filled out at the end of the day. They require the user to
                aggregate the mood over the whole day to a singular value. But what should one enter
                if the day started out miserable and became great over the course of the day?
                Further, the insights gained by connecting a multitude of experiences (the places
                you have been, the people you have met, and the things you have done) to a single
                value seems limited. If you remember them at all. First, the end of the day, when we
                are tired and maybe worn out, is not the best time to correctly remember how we
                have felt. Second, some things are easier to remember than others. Experiences that
                are uncommon or were accompanied by strong feelings will be much easier to remember
                than routines. However, routines fill the largest part of our life and should not be
                discarded.
            </p>
            <h3>The problem with event trackers</h3>
            <p>The neglect of routines is the problem of event trackers as well. We are much more
                likely to add an entry when just something special happened. However, those special
                events are not representative and don’t consistently affect how we feel. In
                contrast, daily hassles or having our routine dinner with our loved ones are the
                things that shape how we feel during the day every day. Further, focusing mostly on
                special events means focusing on extreme feelings. Looking at the resulting data,
                later on, it might appear as there is no grey in all the black and white. But there
                is and it is important not to miss it to get the whole picture.
            </p>
            <h2>Mood tracking with experience sampling</h2>
            <p><i>Experience sampling</i>, also known as <i>ecological momentary assessment</i>, is
                an assessment method used in the social sciences that can overcome the problems of
                diaries and event trackers. The basic idea is that you are asked at random times how
                you feel right at the moment.
            </p>
            <p>By asking at random times one gets a representative sample of one’s mood and how it
                varies in the different situations one experiences. The more often and the longer
                you feel a certain way, the more likely you will be in this mood during one of the
                random assessments, and the more often this mood will be sampled. Therefore, how you
                feel in your day to day life will not be underrepresented and extreme feelings will
                not be overrepresented in the data.
            </p>
            <p>By asking only about the current moment, all forms of recall bias can be avoided. You
                do not need to remember anything. Further, this removes the need to aggregate over
                time-periods. You do not need to weigh a wonderful morning against an awful
                afternoon. Lastly, by only looking at the current moment, finding connections
                between certain situations and specific moods becomes easy. There is no long list of
                places you have been to, things you have done, and people you have met connected to
                one single mood value, but each situation is rated on its own. So, everything can be
                directly linked and if something affects your mood it will become obvious fast.
            </p>
            <h2>Mood tracking with Mood Patterns</h2>
            <p>Those benefits are the reason why Mood Patterns uses experience sampling to collect
                mood data. Of course, completely random sampling has its drawbacks as well. E.g.,
                you probably don’t want to be woken up for an assessment or disturbed during an
                important meeting. That is why Mood Patterns allows tailoring the sampling scheme
                exactly to your needs. At
                <strong>Navigation drawer (&nbsp;&#9776;&nbsp;) -> sampling settings -> schedule</strong>
                you set the time frames when random sampling is on and how often an assessment will
                be prompted. Note that, e.g., the setting <i>1 survey per 1 hour</i> does not mean
                that there will be one survey exactly every hour. It means that there will be
                <i>on average</i> one survey per hour. After all, it is random sampling. So
                there might be hours without even a single survey and then two surveys
                within half an hour. You can change the schedule anytime to adjust to changing
                needs. If you don’t want to be disturbed within your set schedule, then you can
                pause sampling by clicking
                <strong>PAUSE SAMPLING</strong>
                on the start screen and resume sampling by clicking <strong>START SAMPLING</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Once a survey is prompted you have four options. (1) You can take it by clicking
                <strong>&#9654;</strong>
                in the notification, (2) you can postpone it for 15 minutes by clicking <strong>&#9449;</strong>,
              (3) you can dismiss it by clicking <strong>X</strong>, and (4) you can just ignore it. If you
                ignore it, the notification will be dismissed after 15 minutes by default so that
                there is no ambiguity between how you have felt when you first saw the notification
                and when you responded to it. If you want the notification to stay active until you
                react to it, then you can change it at <strong>Settings (&nbsp;&#8942;&nbsp;) -> Notifications:
                    Auto cancel</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Although we favor experience sampling to capture how you feel in your daily life, we
                are fully aware that rare events accompanied by potentially extreme feelings are
                important and influential for your overall emotional state. Therefore, you enter
                your mood any time you like by clicking
                <strong>TAKE SURVEY</strong>
                on the start screen. Or you can click
                <strong>REGISTER EVENT</strong>
                which will provide additional insights in later analysis, like how you have felt
                before and after occurrences of this event. By combining experience sampling with
                event tracking you get the best of the different mood tracking approaches within
                Mood Patterns.
