            <h2>Association between scales</h2>
            <p>
                This view helps you to explore how different kinds of feelings are pairwise related to one another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Select the pair you want to inspect by clicking their crossing point in the scale matrix at the bottom of the view. This will draw how the scale in the row selection would be estimated by the column selection in the detail chart at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the resulting estimation curve increases, then both scales are positively correlated - they rise and fall together. If the estimation curve decreases, then they are negatively correlated - one falls when the other rises and vice versa.
                In the scale matrix, the correlation is color-coded so that you can identify with one glimpse which scales are related.
