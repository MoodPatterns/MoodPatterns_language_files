            <h2>Trend Charts</h2>
            <p>
                The charts show the recent past of your selected scales. To help you detect trends in the zig-zag of ups and downs you can choose to display the curves smoothed (this option only becomes available once there is enough data for smoothing).
            </p>
            <p>
                Except for <i>custom scales</i> (for which you can freely choose the endpoints) higher are normally better than lower values. The axis on the top of the chart indicates the time and the date. You can pinch and zoom into the chart to get more accurate dates.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the charts take too long to load, then you can speed up the process by reducing the number of displayed days. To do so, go to <i>Settings</i>&nbsp;(&nbsp;<b>&#8942;</b>&nbsp;) -> <i>Performance</i> -> <i>Look back size</i>.
            </p>
