            <p>
                This view helps you to explore how your feelings are related to the time of the day.

                The <i>estimate</i> tells you how you feel on average over the course of the day. The <i>confidence range</i> gives you insight how much your recorded values vary. If it is narrow, then most entries have been quite similar.
                A wide confidence range, on the other hand, indicates that you have entered high and low values at this time of the day.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you do not want the day to start and end at midnight, then you can shift the starting time in the top bar at <strong>Adjust start time</strong>&nbsp;(&nbsp;<strong>&#8644;</strong>&nbsp;).
