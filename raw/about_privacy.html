    <p><h2>Privacy Policy</h2></br>
    Bernhard Piskernik built the <i>Mood Patterns</i> app as a commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by Bernhard Piskernik and is intended for use as is.
    This page is used to inform app users regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
    If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service.
    I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
    <p><b>Information Collection and Use</b></br>
    The purpose of this app is to help you collect personal information in the form of a short questionnaire and analyze them. BUT, all collected information is stored and analyzed exclusively, locally on your device. None of this data is shared with us or a third party.
    If you choose to contact us via the contact form an email is sent to us, with your inquiry, your email address, and optionally information about the android version and mobile device (e.g., Samsung S6) you use. This information is used to respond to your inquiry.
    Further, the app does use third party services (Google Play Service) that may collect information used to identify you. For more information on this see below <i>Service Providers</i>.</p>
    <p><b>Log Data</b></br>
    All collected data is exclusively stored locally on your device.</p>
    <p><b>Cookies</b></br>
    This Service does not use “cookies”.</p>
    <p><b>Service Providers</b></br>
    I employ Google Play Service to verify that you have actually paid for the service.
    I want to inform users of this Service that this third party has access to your Google Account information, but not to any mood data you collect with the Mood Patterns App.
    The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on my behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose. </p>
    <p><b>Security</b></br>
    I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. Your personal data is stored only locally and not transmitted over the internet.
    To protect the data on your device the app uses 256-bit AES encryption. BUT, remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    <p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></br>
    This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me.
    Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
    <p><b>Children’s Privacy</b></br>
    This Service does not address anyone under the age of 18. I do not store personal identifiable information from any user.</p>
    <p><b>Changes to This Privacy Policy</b></br>
    I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
    These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
