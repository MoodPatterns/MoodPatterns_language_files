            <h2>Before/After Additional</h2>
            <p>
                This view helps you to explore whether <i>additional data</i> patterns before or after an event have changed. It lists all items that were recorded more often than usual.
            </p>
            <p>
                "More often" is measured by the item's <i>odds ratio</i>. OR for short and indicated by the bold number in each row.
                The OR indicates the relative increase of the item in relation to the total number of entries.
                E.g., 3 means that there are three times more entries than would be expected based on the item frequency in the total sample.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please be aware that probably not every occurrence of each item was recorded, so please interpret the numbers with caution.
                To help you evaluate the reliability of the OR, we also list the item count in the before/after-period and in the entire time-frame.
                If both numbers are low, then it is probably best to take the OR with a grain of salt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, please keep in mind that the view does not list items that were <i>less</i> likely than usual.
